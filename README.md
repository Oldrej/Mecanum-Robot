<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The source of this project was to make a multi-threaded code within Python. This was created with the idea of using it to manoeuvre a Mecanum vehicle that would be able to see and detect obstacles. Initially, we wished to have a scanning system that would round around any object and scan them, giving the user a 3D model of said object. Due to deadline and knowledge, we had to cut that out of the project plan and focus on threading within Python, which was a success.
